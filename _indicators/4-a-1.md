  The percentage of schools by level of education (primary, lower secondary and

  pedagogical purposes is defined as Internet that is available for enhancing
  teaching and learning and is accessible by pupils. Internet for pedagogical
  purposes is defined as a worldwide interconnected computer network, which
  provides pupils access to a number of communication services including the
  World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files,
  irrespective of the device used (i.e. not assumed to be only via a computer)

  digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed narrowband, fixed broadband, or
  via mobile network. Basic drinking water is defined as a functional drinking
  water source (MDG 'improved' categories) on or near the premises and water
  points accessible to all users during school hours. Basic sanitation
  facilities are defined as functional sanitation facilities (MDG 'improved'
  categories) separated for males and females on or near the premises. Basic
  handwashing facilities are defined as functional handwashing facilities, soap
  (or ash) and water available to all girls and boys. The component on adapted
